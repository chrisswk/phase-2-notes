The point: improve as a team.  Identify issues as a team: things that went well, things that didn't go well.  Also to figure out how to do this thing so you are somewhat good at them in the future.  Write post-it notes to document how much fun we had.  Derek understands the microwaves are terrible, not necessarily things that go on the wall but tare necessary feedback.  What didn't go well technically or the dynamics.  Or things that went well.  Or Shambhavi does really good code breakouts.
