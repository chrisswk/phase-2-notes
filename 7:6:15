Sinatra: Very similarly deployed in many instances.

Controllers: initialize lots of variables using active record

Once you have variables initialized in your route, you can access them in your view.  Will use lots of active record while setting up routes.

<% and <%= embedded ruby, how you write ruby within html to get stuff that you want visualized.

= sign means that you're actually printing something to the page.

Architecture behidn sinatra is all mvc based.  The wayyour controllers talk to your views is through erb.

BK: uses the marvel comics API.  Can see what comics heros appeared in and which ones they appeared in together.

Lots of active record, heros are objects, comics are objects.  you can click through a lot of stuff, it is fun.

Seed file: creates fake user accounts.  Found a data dump of the Marvel comics api.  Limited to 100 comics an hour but there are so many that BK needed a dump

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.  Can access a JSON object like an array.

RESTful routes.  The idea is that You have these objects and if you wanted to create an api, it is good practice.

Staunton:
Shows us what is possible after week 2.  For his passion project, he built a site for his Mom's yoga business.

JQuery fade-in, callback function.  Activates the next part of the function.

Only loading the div, not reloading his web pages.  Staunton has a controller for each route.  Creates a different controller for each one.
