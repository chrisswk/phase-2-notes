Agile

Able to move quickly and easily, method of project management characterized by division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptaion of plans.

Let's talk about manufacturing.  Raw materials?  Not necessary.  Original concepts of manufacturing software were based on physical manufacturing.  Ridiculous.

Waterfall development process is the strawman as the opposition to agile except no one has ever used it.  Requirements(Product requirements document) >>  Design(Software architecture) >>  Implementation(Software)  >>  Verification  >>  Maintenance.  How could you possibly design the entire thing berfore you start working on it?  You can't because there are a lot of unknowns.  Back to the manufacturing process because then we needed "raw materials".  Waterfall was described in the paper from 1974 as a process.  The original software projects from the 50s and 60s used this.
