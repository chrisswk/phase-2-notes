Today we'll be talking about helpers and partials.

All Shambhavi is talkiing about is refactoring.  Refactoring your HTML.  Wherever you find repetitive HTML code, group it into an erb file and call the ERB.  Group a particular task into a partial and call it over and over again.

Helpers: Whenever there is a repetitive ruby thing, group that into a separate method and call that method in all your classes.

To start with, Shambhavi just made the craigslist junior challenge.  Lets test the code and the app.

We see the route page.  Options: sign in and sign up.

Signin: Username: field Password: field Sign In: button

On signup, automatically takes user to list of categories.  Can create new cateogries, gets appended.  Can create and read categories and articles.  Logout, takes her to the signin page

What is repetitive?  The create form, the logout button.

Session helper: blank as of now.  models: article, cateogry and user model, which has bcrypt + user authentication.

_article.erb  Ideally rails uses _article to make sure something is a partial.  In order to indicate that it is a partial

How does _article.erb understand what is article.

<%= erb:_article, locals:{article: article} %>

The article local variable is nothing more than 

So, what else?  We can do the same thing for the categories?  The list of categories   _category.erb

Can pretty much take this code and paste it into another partial.  So lets check it out before we do anything.  Let shamsham log out.  Sign in again.  

We were thinkin baout refactoring the form.

We can refactor the form.  Put it inside _form.erb.  The action is different.  

If Shambhavi's partial is inside a form folder: locals: {action: " " } and take the previous form action.  Now it is a string interpolation.

What is the convention for navigation?  Should it be in a separate layout file or in navigation?

With routes in partials, nothing changes.

All about partials.  What about helpers?  It makes it easier to have 2 columns when you're working with two files.

Talking about helpers, why do we need them?  They're nice for readability.  Help to check to see if someone is logged in?  Why not put that logic into a separate method and call it to see if the test is performed or not?

Moving on to the helpers, let SHambhavi get back to her controller.  She has a get route called sign up.  When she is signing up, she has two password. Checks to see if they are corrrectly formatted.  could she just log the user in?

Same way in logout, she can make her code more readable by typing in a method name from the helper folder.

Start with:
  
helpers do
  def login_user(user)
    session[:user_id] = user.id
  end

  def logout_user
    session[:user_id] = nil
  end

  def set_error(error)
    -> logic
  end

end



Helpers are only accessible inside the view and the controller, 

Could redirects happen anywhere other than in the helper method?  No.  Only in the controller.

Shambhavi can replace this and say

get '/' do
  if current_user
end

def current_user
  User.find_by_id(session[:user_id])
end

Could you theoretically wrap every helper method and put them all in one helper file?  Yeah, theoretically.

How do you call a helper file within an erb or controller?

Not sure how to use a layout, knows its defined using yield.  another thing that can be defined in the erb file is layout.  Default is true.  Whatever is done is being inserted within this particular body.  In this case if Shambhavi says, returning to the categories.erb file or articles.  If she says layout: false in the erb <%=  %>.  Layouts only used with partials.

How does all this tie in to the concept of layout?  Layout false means that Shambhavi just wants her partial to be appended to the currently rendered body.

The erb method is also used in the routes.  Definitely want the layout in the routes.  So it is true by default.  layout is always included unless you tell it not to be included.
